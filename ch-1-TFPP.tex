In the first chapter, I would:

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain the fundamentals of functional programming, including \emph{immutable data}, \emph{first-class functions}, \emph{avoidance of side effects}, and \emph{referential transparency}. 
\item Mention the benefits of these concepts, such as \emph{easier parallelization}, \emph{higher-order functions}, and \emph{pattern matching}, in contrast to traditional imperative paradigms.
\item Discuss how Scala flexibly combines both object-oriented and functional approaches.
\end{itemize}
