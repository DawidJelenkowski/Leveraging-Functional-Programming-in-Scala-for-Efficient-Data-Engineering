\textit{Note.} The image depicts a microservices architecture diagram. At the top of the diagram, there are three \textbf{"Client Request"} boxes, representing incoming requests from clients. Below the client requests is an \textbf{"API Gateway"} layer, which serves as the entry point for all client requests. The main body of the diagram shows \textbf{four separate services} (Service A, B, C, and D), representing a distributed service architecture.
