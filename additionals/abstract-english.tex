The potential of functional programming in Scala for efficient data engineering is explored in this thesis. As organizations grapple with ever-increasing volumes of data, the need for scalable, maintainable, and performant data processing systems has become paramount. Scala, a multi-paradigm language that seamlessly blends object-oriented and functional programming concepts, is examined as a powerful tool for addressing these challenges. The core principles of functional programming in Scala are investigated, including immutable data structures, higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, pattern matching, algebraic data types, type classes, and monads. These concepts are demonstrated to provide a solid foundation for building robust data pipelines. The entire data engineering workflow is analyzed, from data ingestion to serving, with a focus on how functional programming paradigms can be applied at each stage. Parallel and distributed data processing techniques are explored, showcasing Scala's capabilities in handling large-scale data operations. Particular attention is given to stream processing, reflecting its growing importance in modern data architectures. Popular stream processing frameworks in Scala are evaluated, and their strengths in real-time data analysis are highlighted. The critical aspects of testing, deploying, and monitoring data pipelines are addressed. Various testing methodologies tailored for Scala are examined, underlining the importance of comprehensive testing in ensuring reliable and efficient data processing systems. Deployment strategies, including cloud deployment, are discussed, along with best practices for monitoring and optimizing data pipelines in production environments. Through this comprehensive exploration, it is demonstrated that functional programming in Scala offers a powerful toolkit for addressing the complexities of modern data engineering.
