\begin{lstlisting}
val x = 1 + 2 * 3 // How it is normally written
val y = 1.+(2.*(3)) // To what the code is transformed under the hood
\end{lstlisting}

\textit{Note.} This table illustrates Scala's uniform object model, where arithmetic operators are translated into method invocations on objects.
