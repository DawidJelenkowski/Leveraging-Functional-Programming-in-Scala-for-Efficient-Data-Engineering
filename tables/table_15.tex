sealed trait Shape
case class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape
case class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape
case class Triangle(base: Double, height: Double) extends Shape
\end{lstlisting}

\textit{Note.} In this example, the \textbf{Shape} ADT represents different geometric shapes. It is defined as a sealed trait, and the individual shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) are defined as case classes that extend the \textbf{Shape} trait. This allows for the creation of a type-safe and expressive data model for representing shapes.
