\textit{Note.} This example uses throttling to limit the rate of data flow, ensuring bounded resource consumption even with fast producers. \textbf{Reactive Streams} ensure that system resources are used efficiently by \textbf{bounding} the number of elements that can be in-flight at any given time. This prevents memory overflow and system crashes due to unbounded queues.
