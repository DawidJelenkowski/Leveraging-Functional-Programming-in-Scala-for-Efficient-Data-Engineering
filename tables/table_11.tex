\textit{Note.} In this example, the \textbf{data} value is defined as a lazy value. The initialization code inside the block is not executed until \textbf{data} is accessed for the first time. This allows for the deferred execution of potentially expensive computations and enables the creation of data processing pipelines that can handle large datasets efficiently.
