\textit{Note.} In this example, the buffer stage with OverflowStrategy.backpressure ensures that if the downstream processing is slow, the upstream will be notified to slow down its production rate. \textbf{Back pressure} is a mechanism that allows consumers to signal to producers about their current capacity to handle data. This prevents fast producers from overwhelming slow consumers, ensuring system stability.
