\textit{Note.} In this example, \textbf{mapAsync} allows for asynchronous processing of each element in the stream, maintaining responsiveness even with time-consuming operations. \textbf{Reactive Streams} are designed to \textbf{handle data asynchronously}, allowing for non-blocking operations. This is crucial for building responsive systems that can handle high volumes of data without becoming unresponsive.
